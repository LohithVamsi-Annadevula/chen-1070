Assignments submitted late (“up to 1 day”)\nwill be assessed a penalty of 50% and assignments submitted later than one day will be assessed as zero.\nHomework will often require significant effort to complete and will often represent material and\ninformation that are relevant for successfully completing quizzes. Homework is ultimately the secret to\nlearning any subject – you have to practice in order to truly integrate knowledge and become proficient\nin new ideas and solving problems. Thus, even though homework is not always numerically the most\nsignificant aspect of the overall course grade (as course percentage) it is perhaps the most important\nindividual component which determines the ultimate outcome.\n\n|**Course Grading Procedure** |**Value**|\n|:----------------------------|:-------:|\n| Lecture assignments         |  35%    |\n| Lab assignments             |  35%    |\n| Technical report            |  20%    |\n| Attendance                  |  10%    |\n    \n|**Letter Grade Scale** |**Value**|\n|:----------------------|:-------:|\n| A                     | 92+     |\n| A-                    | 87–91.9 |\n| B+                    | 82–86.9 |\n| B                     | 77–81.9 |\n| B-                    | 72–76.9 |\n| C+                    | 67–71.9 |\n| C                     | 62–66.9 |\n| C-                    | 58–61.9 |\n| D+                    | 54–57.9 |\n| D                     | 50–53.9 |\n| F                     | <50     |",
